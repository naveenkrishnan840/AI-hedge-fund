# AI Hedge Fund

This is a proof of concept for an AI-powered hedge fund.  The goal of this project is to explore the use of AI to make trading decisions.  This project is for **educational** purposes only and is not intended for real trading or investment.

This system employs several agents working together:

1. Bill Ackman Agent - Uses Bill Ackman's principles to generate trading signals
2. Warren Buffett Agent - Uses Warren Buffett's principles to generate trading signals
3. Valuation Agent - Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and generates trading signals
4. Sentiment Agent - Analyzes market sentiment and generates trading signals
5. Fundamentals Agent - Analyzes fundamental data and generates trading signals
6. Technicals Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
7. Risk Manager - Calculates risk metrics and sets position limits
8. Portfolio Manager - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/naveenkrishnan840/AI-hedge-fund.git
cd AI-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
# Create .env file for your API keys
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Set your API keys:
```bash
# For running LLMs hosted by groq (deepseek, llama3, etc.)
# Get your Groq API key from https://console.cloud.google.com/
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-api-key

# For getting financial data to power the hedge fund
# Get your Financial Datasets API key from https://financialdatasets.ai/
FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY=your-financial-datasets-api-key
```

**Important**: You must set `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, for the hedge fund to work.  If you want to use LLMs from all providers, you will need to set all API keys.

Financial data for AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA is free and does not require an API key.

For any other ticker, you will need to set the `FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY` in the .env file.
